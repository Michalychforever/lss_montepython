These are the custom-built [BOSS DR12](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03155) galaxy power spectra likelihoods for Montepython that were analyzed in the papers 

* [*Cosmological Parameters from the BOSS Galaxy Power Spectrum*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05277)
* [*Cosmological Parameters and Neutrino Masses from the Final Planck and Full-Shape BOSS Data*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08208) 
* [*Combining Full-Shape and BAO Analyses of Galaxy Power Spectra: A 1.6% CMB-independent constraint on H0*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.04035)

The repo includes: 

* Pre-reconstructed full-shape (FS) power spectrum likelihods for four independent data chunks: North and South Galactic Caps (NGC and SGC) at z=0.38 and z=0.61
* Joint FS+BAO likelihoods with the appropriate covariance matrices for the same data chunks
