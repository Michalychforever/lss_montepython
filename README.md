These are the custom BOSS DR12 galaxy power spectra likelihoods for Montepython that were analyzed in the papers 

* *Cosmological Parameters from the BOSS Galaxy Power Spectrum* [arxiv 1909.05277](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05277)
* *Cosmological Parameters and Neutrino Masses from the Final Planck and Full-Shape BOSS Data* (arxiv 1912.08208)
* *Combining Full-Shape and BAO Analyses of Galaxy Power Spectra: A 1.6% CMB-independent constraint on H0* (arxiv 2002.04035)

The repo includes: 

* Pre-reconstructed full-shape (FS) power spectrum likelihods for four independent data chunks: North and South Galactic Caps (NGC and SGC) at z=0.38 and z=0.61
* Joint FS+BAO likelihoods with the appropriate covariance matrices for the same data chunks
